Our app, Gamblation, is comprised of a blackjack type system where the player presses hit or stand,
 if either player receives a deck worth 21 points, they win. Some problems my team & I had,
 were making the dealer sort of sentient in a way. There were so many chances of different things happening,
 so we had to play the game many different times to fix bugs,
 set variables so that he wouldnâ€™t get stuck on a certain number, etc..
 the way we ended up fixing it was we gathered data from rolling it 100 times,
 out of the ones that broke, we found a common problem, and sorted it out from there.
